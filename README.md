## react-redux-uuid

A place to keep your disposable but application-related component state data

### Why would you need this

Sometimes you write components that hold some app data that you would like to keep in your redux
state, but sometimes these components dont have an unique key in the redux state because there's an
undefined number of instances of your component across the app.

### Quick Example

```jsx
// declaration of your Autocomplete.js component

const Autocomplete = ({ options }) => (
  ...
)

const mapStateToProps = (state /* this is the componet's unique state */) => {
  return {
    options: state.options
  }
}

export default connectUUID('autocomplete', mapStateToProps)(Autocomplete);

// using it somewhere else

<div>
  <Autocomplete />
  <Autocomplete />
  <Autocomplete />
</div>

// each of the Autocomplete components opens up a new key in your app's state

uuid: {
  autocomplete: {
    // autogenerated uuids by this lib
    'bc1de127-0962-43a6-a224-9cc4716da4b6': {...},
    'cc94ccb8-85a3-407a-9fc0-cc895459b422': {...},
    '41952137-e54c-4f9e-be08-07ffe11ee554': {...}
  }
}
```

## API

### `createUUIDReducer(reducers)`

Creates your UUID reducer, make sure to place its result state under `state.uuid`

#### Arguments

* `reducers` (_Object<key, reducer>_): An object map of reducers, where each `<key>` sets the
reducer's *name* (see `connectUUID(name, ...args)`)

#### Returns

A reducer that will filter out redux actions that go through it to the corresponding reducer

#### Example

```js
const mainAppReducer = combineReducers({
  uuid: createUUIDReducer({
    counter: counterReducer,
    fizzbuzz: fizzbuzzReducer
  })
})
```

### `connectUUID(name, [mapStateToProps], [mapDispatchToProps])`

Creates a HoC to connect your component to it's corresponding reducer state, its very similar to
react-redux's `connect`

#### Arguments

* `name` (_String_): The name of the corresponding reducer that this HoC will use from the reducer
object map passed on to `createUUIDReducer` in the main reducer declaration
* `[mapStateToProps]`: See [react-redux's docs](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options)
* `[mapDispatchToProps]`: See [react-redux's docs](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options)

#### Returns

A function that injects the inner state and wrapped action creators into your component.
